"The experience was great! I was able to purchase the e-book first, to be ready to read with my book club. Then I was able to order the printed paper copy within a few days, and due to the affordability of the e-book, and paper book- the portability of having BOTH versions available was amazing. I am sad that the e-book version does not like either my tablet or my phone or my laptop. The page numbers hover etc. This is sad. I continue to be frustrated that either the world is android or apple and no-two can mix.",-0.1536
